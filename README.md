# Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis
## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices and sentimental analysis of news headlines  
  
+ Stock chosen to analyze and predict: HDFC Bank Limited (HDFCBANK.BO)  
+ Historical stock data available at: [Historic stock data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HDFCBANK.NS/history?p=HDFCBANK.NS)  
+ Textual data (Times Of India headlines from Jan2001 to Dec2020) available at: [Harvard Dataverse](https://bit.ly/36fFPI6)  
+ Machine Learning Algorithm used: Chained Multioutput Random Forest Regression  
+ Accuracy: R-square value of 0.9994 (model explains 99.94% of variability of data)
+ kernel used for development/testing: kaggle
